## To Refines
- Cultures
- Holy sites/ Religions & their icons
- Characters (traits, stats)
- name list by culture (mainly Kaito, Dragon, Unicorn & Mantis?)
- Add more historic characters (source : V5 in priority, V4/V1 if family/relationship needed)
- traits & their icons
- dynasty & titles kamon for vassal families, some minor clans (moth), reworked the existing ones
- localization (missing one and change already existing one, like "levies" -> "ashigaru levies" for instance)
- How Minor/Major clan titles are handled
- innovation (special culture ones) and shared ones. Re-localization of some
- Colors of clothes variations
- Events ideas
- more artifacts

# TO TEST
- TEST  Struggle Shadowlands ?
	- Vassal titles destruction upon failed invasion
	- war leader title destruction upon failed invasion
	- try invalidating the invasion ?

	- any county in region_all has no loc, do not use it (or custom tt)

- TEST onsen visit activity !
	- change the desc activityes
	- add a desc line on onsen to tell that it unlocks the activity (like forest groudn as well) (or give more good results)

## CK3 1.13.* patch
- Add travel images background for shadowlands
	- change the volcanic plains dds to shadowlands one
- update vanilla travel background for acitivites to add shadowlands bg
	- graphical_shadowlands_trigger = yes
- New Shadowlands stuff
	- up ishigaki bridge a little
	- move down yukiko 13 & forgotten 13 bridge
- remove bunch of errors
- Decision to tatoo => Wounded message in option incorrect for some reasons. Maybe because both the effect and the tooltip are random ?
- Fix era time line. 
- see loc "castellanny of fu leng stuff" when conquered by rokugani guy
- more namelists & dynasty list
- ck3tiger fixes to do !
- "son of heaven" even if female ruler loc to fix. Does it happens ?
- Bug Why kingdom have no de-jure drifts ?
- Shiro Kaikoga => Wrong religion & culture 
- Add thumbnail image for the mod !
- add images for mma

- Still some backgrounds are buggy for feudal shadowlands ? Child ruler shadowlands ?

## short term goals 
- finish shindoshi decision for MAGIC (at least for air kami)
- Why so much empty space in portrait debug mod ?
- Create MaA for each great clan
	- add special icons/images for MaA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (crab, oni & crane done, rest to do)
- transform "mahotsukai" trait into the secret / trait combo of witch


## Fixes to do
- Spammed with rokugan_char_interaction.0231 event boxes...
	- "an honorable death" event procs for outsite of player stuff
- shiba mon is off-center (too much top left)
- update dynasty decisions (taken from shogunate)
- Added demand seppuku character interaction ? (and made by liege too)
	- Issue with Opinion crimed (but no idea how HAS_AN_IMPRISONMENT_REASON_ON_CHARACTER works)
- Issues with missing accolades in innovations description ? Why ?
- start war on toshi Rambo / city rich frog decision
	- Bug : on_war_transferred => war_event.2001 gets called because we target the small owner instead of the big liege. 
- DNA is changed (hair/mustache) between bookmark

## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Set up github branches (dev/release/beta) and pratices/rights

##  Waiting & placeholders
- Add CoA placeholder : Kingdom of Cherry blossom and that's it ?

## Workaround to be careful with & unsure behaviours
- WORKAROUND : Doji Hotaru black hair on bookmarks to avoid having white hair children without the crane trait
- WORKAROUND : The l5r_title_events.0001 events breaks vassalage (but AI fixes it quickly anyway, so that's ok). Maybe enhance the script to give vassals as well ?
- BUG : How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance. Add more family (aka heirs)
- BUG : start war on toshi Rambo / city rich frog decision
	- Bug : on_war_transferred => war_event.2001 gets called because we target the small owner instead of the big liege. 
- BUG : weird log issue : [19:35:39][characterhistory.cpp:801]: Parent ( Hantei of  (Internal ID: 3 - Historical ID lineofhantei1)) of name_genji Lowborn of  (Internal ID: 18 - Historical ID lineofhantei2) is hasn't been born
- BUG : We cannot raid inside the same realm. Thus Mantis won't raid Cranes :(
- BUG the weird 's issue. Happens for event yearly.8400.a for insteance
	- I guess it is the "select_and_move_to_pool_effect" localization which fails ?
	- Object of type 'character' is not valid for 'GetCourtConcept' ???
	- happens in Vanilla, so prod issue, not mod issue
- BUG : (spammed error) unit_japanese_infantry_02_shield_entity has no attachment node named shield_effect_2
- BUG during duel : 	
	Error: Invalid left side during comparison 'var'
	Script location: file: common/customizable_localization/00_signature_weapon_custom_localization.txt line: 380 (SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavyPlural)

# Ideas
### How-to Different species (Ã  la Lotr)
- stat, life expectancies :  based on the heritage of the culture
- in lotr_race_triggers : culture_conversion_to_allowed_culture & same_race & has_same_species_as. it is used everywhere to prevent weird culture stuff
	- prevent bethrohal in lotr_betrothal_to_allowed
	- prevent cultural hybridization for instance : lotr_is_spirit_culture_trigger usage in "scripted_triggers" dir, used in 00_culture_interactions & culture_events/culture_emergence_events
	- present in scripted_rules\00_rules
