## To Refines
- Cultures
- Holy sites/ Religions & their icons
- Characters (traits, stats)
- name list by culture (mainly Kaito, Dragon & Unicorn ?)
- Add more historic characters (source : V5 in priority, V4/V1 if family/relationship needed)
- traits & their icons
- dynasty & titles kamon for vassal families, some minor clans (moth), reworked the existing ones
- Question : generated kamon à la shogunate for random dynasties/titles ?
- localization (missing one and change already existing one, like "levies" -> "ashigaru levies" for instance)
- How Minor/Major clan titles are handled
- innovation (special culture ones) and shared ones. Re-localization of some
- Colors of clothes variations
- Events ideas
- more artifacts

## short term goals 
- Create MaA for each great clan, (do the same for minor later)
	- MaA preferences by heritage => Building_Modifiers.txt & 04_ep2_maa_attributes to update
	- 00_men_at_arms_values to update too
	- update culture_has_skirmisher_maa to each culture with such maa
	- basic Mma and levies localization !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	- add special icons/images for MaA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (crab done, rest to do)
- add volcano + texture for dragon lands. How to add new special building in the map (like a bridge for instance)???? 

## Fixes to do
- Change localization of knights from "Hetaeria" to "Bushi" ?
c_conflagration_temple & c_shinden_kasai are still county of Hantei...
- Spammed with rokugan_char_interaction.0231 event boxes...
	- "an honorable death" event procs for outsite of player stuff
- Fix the "Family Lands of Daidoji lands"; "Clan of Crane Clan", etc...
- Change color of some textured emblmes (very low priority) : Mantis, Komori
- shiba mon is off-center (too much top left)
- update holy_order decisions & dynasty decisions (taken from shogunate)
- fix title for tribal leader & Theocracy leader of countries/+++ => Ask help to FUN ? Rework ?
	- Check the "Family name before surname" used in "Oriental Empires" mod
	- check Kizoku title & Khan title => Rework of how title are displayed and calculated.
	- "Lowborn" being used as a family name lol
- Doctor have no clothes !
-Change Mod Thumbnail image (test ?)

## Workaround to be careful with & unsure behaviours
- headgear remove for all (sub_saharian headgear, why ? Workaround = delete reference to this headgear)
- Remove AI Cadet branches => Working ?
- Doji Hotaru black hair on bookmarks to avoid having white hair children without the crane trait
- How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance. Add more family (aka heirs)

##  Waiting & placeholders
- Cat mon : @Bamba 
- Add CoA placeholder : missing Frog Duchy, Kingdom of Cherry blossom and that's it ?

## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Special events setting the start of the clan wars
- Duel to end War (check Tales of Ireland mod)
- Innovations
	- Wootz Steel -> Kaiu Steel (reskin)
	- Gaijin trade (Mantis/Tortoise)
- Volcano for Dragon (cf Discord "CK3 Volcano Map Items" shared ressources)!
- Have a nice paper map à la Shogunate when zooming out.
- Added demand seppuku character interaction ? (and made by liege too)
	- Issue with Opinion crimed (but no idea how HAS_AN_IMPRISONMENT_REASON_ON_CHARACTER works)
- add "animal" (clan animal) as motif for CoA (instead of just textured one)
	- generated dynasties of ronins have random CoA
- Events for l5R => "yearly_on_actions.txt"/on_yearly_events (for instance). Ideas
	- Random duels
	- Paiting stuff
	- TEa
	-Opium
	- others
- add activites map object data on each county ? capital county ?
- genes & ethnicities
- Add modifiers to dynasties to prove their link to great clans ????
- defines geo regions => For animals/trees/etc...
- Prevent imperial family from doing wars against other clans...? Only for AI ? or not ?
- Blood feud (like Matsu vs Kakita)	: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2914047110. Need the Friends & Foes DLC sadly...
	- shogunate_bookmark_events.txt/shogunate_bookmark.8300/shogunate_historical_feud_effect => shogunate_bookmark_effects/shogunate_bookmark.8310
	- add more events? Duels ?
- Add court (from Shogunate)
- Artifacts creation process
- Add ancestral clan & family founders
	- Special naming convention for Kamis (no first name)
	- Kami traits/kami descendent à la Shayoshant/paragon of vertue

### How-to Clothes
 Add japanese clothing, add credit (AJ cf how AEP has done)
	- Understand how it works (https://discord.com/channels/735413460439007241/735413461680652366/1122255742129410068 &  https://discord.com/channels/735413460439007241/735413461680652366/791031025907662868 helps a bit)

# Ideas
### How-to Different species (à la Lotr)
- stat, life expectancies :  based on the heritage of the culture
- in lotr_race_triggers : culture_conversion_to_allowed_culture & same_race. it is used everywhere to prevent weird culture stuff
	- prevent bethrohal in lotr_betrothal_to_allowed
	- prevent cultural hybridization for instance : lotr_is_spirit_culture_trigger usage in "scripted_triggers" dir, used in 00_culture_interactions & culture_events/culture_emergence_events
	- present in scripted_rules\00_rules
