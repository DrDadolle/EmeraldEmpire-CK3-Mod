## To Refines
- Cultures
- Holy sites/ Religions & their icons
- Characters (traits, stats)

- traits & their icons
- dynasty & titles kamon for vassal families, some minor clans (moth), reworked the existing ones
- localization (missing one and change already existing one, like "levies" -> "ashigaru levies" for instance)
- How Minor/Major clan titles are handled
- innovation (special culture ones) and shared ones. Re-localization of some
- Colors of clothes variations
- Events ideas
- more artifacts

# TO TEST
- Test phoenix acclamation stuff

- change events of shadowlands ending images appropriately

## CK3 1.13.* patch
-Only B8G8R8A8_UNORM support so far. => Wrong color encoding
	Gimp 2: Use .DDS plugin and use Export as ABGR8 format, .DDS with Compression=None.
	OR compress as BC2 / DXT3 ? => check kami_descendant trait => NOT WORKING :(
	OR https://www.gimp-forum.net/attachment.php?aid=2871
- Add à la AGOT an event when emperor dies "Succession of the Iron Throne" title event
- Replace the conquer cassus belli internal by the AGOT Neighbour CB ?
- update vanilla travel background for acitivites to add shadowlands bg
	- graphical_shadowlands_trigger = yes
- More baronnies in spice & silk islands
	- Some more Shinoment county as well for nezumi
	- more in Shiba lands as well ??
- New Shadowlands stuff
	- up ishigaki bridge a little
	- move down yukiko 13 & forgotten 13 bridge
- remove bunch of errors
- Fix era time line. 
- more namelists & dynasty list
- ck3tiger fixes to do !
- "son of heaven" even if female ruler loc to fix. Does it happens ?
- Shiro Kaikoga => Wrong religion & culture, why ?
- add images for mma
- Why people can be eunuch ?! wtf even Dark Moto Tsume ?! 
- Update activites terrain with shadowlands, as well as activity_backgrounds.txt
- for namelists, use "dynasty_name_first = yes" flag for L5R ??? Avoid doing all the weird stuff in name
- update ep3_constantinople => otosan_uchi
- add description for is_otosan_uchi (ep3_laamp_decision_events) (ep3_laamp_decision_event.1000.desc_outro_revisit_constantinople for instance)
-Nezumi shinomen placement TODO
	- religion nezumi icon
	- How to prevent crab to annihilate Nezumis ? The faith is "hostile" after all
- add trait_portrait_modifiers for undead based on elder-kings lich stuff
- Add thumbnail image for the mod !
	
## short term goals 
- finish shindoshi decision for MAGIC (at least for air kami)
- Why so much empty space in portrait debug mod ?
- Create MaA for each great clan
	- add special icons/images for MaA ! (crab, oni & crane done, rest to do)

## Fixes to do
- Spammed with rokugan_char_interaction.0231 event boxes...
	- "an honorable death" event procs for outsite of player stuff
- shiba mon is off-center (too much top left)
- Added demand seppuku character interaction ? (and made by liege too)
	- Issue with Opinion crimed (but no idea how HAS_AN_IMPRISONMENT_REASON_ON_CHARACTER works)
- Issues with missing accolades in innovations description ? Why ?
- DNA is changed (hair/mustache) between bookmark


## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Set up github branches (dev/release/beta) and pratices/rights


## Workaround to be careful with & unsure behaviours
- WORKAROUND : Doji Hotaru black hair on bookmarks to avoid having white hair children without the crane trait
- WORKAROUND : The l5r_title_events.0001 events breaks vassalage (but AI fixes it quickly anyway, so that's ok). Maybe enhance the script to give vassals as well ?
- BUG : How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance. Add more family (aka heirs)
- BUG : start war on toshi Rambo / city rich frog decision
	- Bug : on_war_transferred => war_event.2001 gets called because we target the small owner instead of the big liege. 
- BUG : weird log issue : [19:35:39][characterhistory.cpp:801]: Parent ( Hantei of  (Internal ID: 3 - Historical ID lineofhantei1)) of name_genji Lowborn of  (Internal ID: 18 - Historical ID lineofhantei2) is hasn't been born
- BUG : We cannot raid inside the same realm. Thus Mantis won't raid Cranes :(
- BUG the weird 's issue. Happens for event yearly.8400.a for insteance
	- I guess it is the "select_and_move_to_pool_effect" localization which fails ?
	- Object of type 'character' is not valid for 'GetCourtConcept' ???
	- happens in Vanilla, so prod issue, not mod issue
- BUG : (spammed error) unit_japanese_infantry_02_shield_entity has no attachment node named shield_effect_2
- BUG during duel : 	
	Error: Invalid left side during comparison 'var'
	Script location: file: common/customizable_localization/00_signature_weapon_custom_localization.txt line: 380 (SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavyPlural)
=====================================================================================================
============ STOP DEV FEATURES & START POLISHING & ADD 3D/2D ASSETS THEN ASK FOR TESTERS ============
=====================================================================================================
- Events for l5R => "yearly_on_actions.txt"/on_yearly_events (for instance). Ideas
	- Random duels
	- Paiting stuff
	- Opium
	- others
	- introduce_a_new_fashion_at_court_decision for Crane ? @Imperial court ?
- defines geo regions => For animals/trees/etc... (map_data/geographical_regions/aaa.txt)
	- Modify definition of Lion & Scorpion to have Beiden pass properly defined
	- Modify definition of phoenix/neutral for isawamori/shinomenmori
	- Modify definition of mountains (close to Dragon) of phoenix & phoenix coasts
	- same for Unicorn => duchy put but they are spread out in reality...
	- same for crane
	- same for crab
- Add special regional tradition for shadowlands
	- buff developtments, hunt chances, etc... (like mountain homes i.e)
	- character_view_bg in gfx, need to add some fallback images
	- update hunt.txt and other stuff
	- check in various events where terrain type is important
- Add dejure drift for county into duchy (cf new total conversion mod ?)
- Special events setting the start of the clan wars
	- Doji Hotaru
	- Doji Kuwanan
	- Akodo Toturi
- use "event invasion of vikings" for yobanjin
- transform "mahotsukai" trait into the secret / trait combo of witch
- add choice of new mon and names for new minor clans !
	- boar clan (disappear mysteriously) https://l5r.fandom.com/wiki/Boar_Clan?file=Boar.png
	- firefly 
	- Otter (?)
	- tanuki (ask permission)
	- tiger clan (ask permission)
- Duel to end War (check Tales of Ireland mod)
- Universities ?
- Shindoshi court position ??
- Artifacts creation process
- Add ancestral clan & family founders
	- Special naming convention for Kamis (no first name)
- Integrate "Border Disputes" mod ?
- More mythical creatures for artifact_custom_loc.txt ?
- Add modifiers to dynasties to prove their link to great clans ????
- genes & ethnicities
- Add river map (more ?)
- Pilgrimage images (update scripted_illustration/ingame.txt)
- Check Major Clan decision
	- Are the "duchy" minor clan & the "kingdom" major clan titles special titles ? Rework those titles with a special flag "recognized_major_clan" for instance. Are they all landless à la Hiruma ?
	- Name of Kingdom title. Duchy titles become "[DYNASTY] lands"
- special buildings
	- Kaiu Wall (done) : add models from AEP
- if emperor : get a doji bride
- if emperor : all siblings goes to "Otomo" once there is an heir + The revert decision
- Bug Why kingdom have no de-jure drifts ? Inside same de_jure empire. Change de jure drift rules ?
- Emerald Champion stuff ?
	- Current elective candidate set types DO NOT correspond to how it is done. This stuff is hard coded sadly.
	- Workaround => Give the claim to all duke/kingdom level characters under e_rokugan, then use title_claimants has both electors & candidate
- Special Phoenix champion succession, test it !
	- rework princely election, with special character "Ofushikai" being out of map immortal 
	- Current issues : only Holder can vote => Special landess title of Ofushikai.
	- the system needs the current holder to vote.
	- Idea => Create a special succession, and not a princely election ! Without a character Ofushikai !
	- Must hardcode this as an event, impossible to have "random inheritance" currently
- Phoenix Council of 5 special government
- Togashi special succession ?
- Special weapon & artifacts
- Black scrolls, cursed artifacts
- Bunch of new events !
- Shindoshi stuff 
- Maho stuff (very low priority)
	- Tomb of Iuchiban special building ?
- Shadowlands stuff (very low priority)
- Clan decisions
	- reclaim ancestral hiruma lands as Hiruma familly
- TODO japanese female armor variation (Need models )
- Better color clothing variation for ALL minor/imperial/great clans

# Ideas
### How-to Different species (à la Lotr)
- stat, life expectancies :  based on the heritage of the culture
- in lotr_race_triggers : culture_conversion_to_allowed_culture & same_race & has_same_species_as. it is used everywhere to prevent weird culture stuff
	- prevent bethrohal in lotr_betrothal_to_allowed
	- prevent cultural hybridization for instance : lotr_is_spirit_culture_trigger usage in "scripted_triggers" dir, used in 00_culture_interactions & culture_events/culture_emergence_events
	- present in scripted_rules\00_rules
