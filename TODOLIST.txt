## To Refines
- Cultures
- Holy sites/ Religions & their icons
- Characters (traits, stats)
- name list by culture (mainly Kaito, Dragon & Unicorn ?)
- Add more historic characters (source : V5 in priority, V4/V1 if family/relationship needed)
- traits & their icons
- dynasty & titles kamon for vassal families, some minor clans (moth), reworked the existing ones
- Question : generated kamon à la shogunate for random dynasties/titles ?
- localization (missing one and change already existing one, like "levies" -> "ashigaru levies" for instance)
- How Minor/Major clan titles are handled
- innovation (special culture ones) and shared ones. Re-localization of some

## short term goals 
- Add DLC L5R Icons in gfx/interface/illustrations/dlc_event_decorations/, which is the icon that shows up in the top right corner of your events. 526x128 resolution, A8R8G8B8, no mipmaps (cf "How to add a content source to your events" discord)
- edit the dlc_button in gui/frontend_bookmarks.gui (cf "How to add a content source to your events" discord)
- add 1.12.5 Events - Basic Sanitation (cf discord)
- check Asia Expansion, ask for rights W8t 4 response
- Moth mon : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/567780175824027688/727586930145099846/mothmon4.png?ex=664edde2&is=664d8c62&hm=a9bf70387d71393919c2641a7455880a49ff78897ccb2e31043371c153a10114&

## Fixes to do
- Fix the "Family Lands of Daidoji lands"; "Clan of Crane Clan", etc...
- Change color of some textured emblmes (very low priority)
- update holy_order decisions & dynasty decisions (taken from shogunate)
- fix title for tribal leader & Theocracy leader of countries/+++ => Ask help to FUN ? Rework ?
found_empire_decision)
- check Kizoku title & Khan title => Rework of how title are displayed and calculated.
- How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance
- Child can be born with white hair but without the Crane trait !

## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Remove AI Cadet branches => Working ?
- Becoming Minor or Major Clan IS a special decision which requires the Emperor acknowledgement.
	- Adaptation of the decision "create custom kingdom" but for duchy ?
	- Adaptation of the decision "create custom kingdom" (found_kingdom_decision & found_empire_decision from 80_major_decisions.txt)
	- diseable the "create de_jure kingdom" option ?????
	- Are the "duchy" minor clan & the "kingdom" major clan titles special titles ? Rework those titles with a special flag "recognized_major_clan" for instance. Are they all landless à la Hiruma ?
- Special decisions
	-Become Great Clan : Requires X Duchy or Y counties. Emperor positive relation. Emperor MUST be direct liege. Name of Duchy Title => Name of Kingdom title. Duchy titles become "[DYNASTY] lands"
		- No other ways to create a kingdom title. Basically rework existing mechanics
 	- Become Great Clan (Kingdom) as (Mantis ?) Minor Clan 
	- reclaim ancestral hiruma lands as Hiruma familly
	- if emperor : get a doji bride
	- if emperor : all siblings goes to "Otomo" once there is an heir + The revert decision

- Prevent imperial family from doing wars against other clans...? Only for AI ?
- Blood feud (like Matsu vs Kakita)	
- special buildings
	- Hall of Ancestors Lion
	- Otosan Uchi
	- Traitor's Trove
	- Tsuma Topaz building
	- Chuda Ruins

	- 	effect = {make_character_crypto_religionist_effect = { CRYPTO_RELIGION = faith:zun_pagan }} 
- Special events setting the start of the clan wars
- Create MaA for each great clan, maybe each minor one
	- MaA preferences by heritage => Building_Modifiers.txt & 04_ep2_maa_attributes to update
	- 00_men_at_arms_values to update too
	- update culture_has_skirmisher_maa to each culture with such maa
	- basic Mma and levies localization
- Add ancestral clan & family founders
- artifacts (non nemuranai). Fluff in "Celestial realms"
 	- Chikara, ancestral sword of the crab, jade laced, nemuranai. Cannot be damaged. Is a Chokuto
	- 5 Doji blades by Doji Yasuragi
		Shukujo, ancestral sword of the crane. If descendant direct of Doji, more bonus. Uchigatana, for duel.
	- The blade with no name -> No a sword but a concept. Should be special events.

	- Ofushikai, ancestral sword of the Phoenix. Tachi. Contains Shiba & ko. Cannot be damaged nor stolen. Only usable by clan champion phoenix.

	- Gaijin trade (Mantis/Tortoise)
- Added demand seppuku character interaction ? (and made by liege too)
	- Issue with Opinion crimed (but no idea how HAS_AN_IMPRISONMENT_REASON_ON_CHARACTER works)
- ============ STOP DEV FEATURES & START POLISHING & ADD 3D/2D ASSETS THEN RELEASE ====================
- Special Phoenix champion succession, test it !
	- rework princely election, with special character "Ofushikai" being out of map immortal 
	- Current issues : only Holder can vote => Special landess title of Ofushikai.
	- the system needs the current holder to vote.
	- Idea => Create a special succession, and not a princely election ! Without a character Ofushikai !

# Decisions Done
- Bleach Hair White (crane) and it's opposite
- Avenge Yasuki War (crane)
- Commit Seppuku (when dishonored)


# Permissions to asks
- Asia Expansion Project @ Longus Cattus => Japanese court, clothes
- Tachi CK3 Mod dev, for inspiration
- FUN for background images for council, characters, court, etc...

# Ideas
### How-to Different species (à la Lotr)
- stat, life expectancies :  based on the heritage of the culture
- in lotr_race_triggers : culture_conversion_to_allowed_culture & same_race. it is used everywhere to prevent weird culture stuff
	- prevent bethrohal in lotr_betrothal_to_allowed
	- prevent cultural hybridization for instance : lotr_is_spirit_culture_trigger usage in "scripted_triggers" dir, used in 00_culture_interactions & culture_events/culture_emergence_events
	- present in scripted_rules\00_rules
