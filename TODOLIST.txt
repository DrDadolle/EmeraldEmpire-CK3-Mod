## To Refines
- Cultures
- Holy sites/ Religions & their icons
- Characters (traits, stats)
- name list by culture (mainly Kaito, Dragon & Unicorn ?)
- Add more historic characters (source : V5 in priority, V4/V1 if family/relationship needed)
- traits & their icons
- dynasty & titles kamon for vassal families, some minor clans (moth), reworked the existing ones
- Question : generated kamon à la shogunate for random dynasties/titles ?
- localization (missing one and change already existing one, like "levies" -> "ashigaru levies" for instance)
- How Minor/Major clan titles are handled
- innovation (special culture ones) and shared ones. Re-localization of some

## short term goals 
- check how to add katana + variation.
- check Asia Expansion, ask for rights W8t 4 response
- Cat mon : @Bamba => add a placeholder with a cat meme so repleacement is easy
- Add japanese clothing, add credit (AJ cf how AEP has done)
	- Understand how it works (https://discord.com/channels/735413460439007241/735413461680652366/1122255742129410068 &  https://discord.com/channels/735413460439007241/735413461680652366/791031025907662868 helps a bit)
	- Add sub_group for clothings, with a dedicated color palette for each clan/cultures which makes sense cf https://discord.com/channels/735413460439007241/735413461403566119/1143509272567746663
	- TODO female armor variation (Need models ?), katana,
- Add CoA à la AGOT for all baronnies/counties +++ (ronin done : missing Kingdoms/duchies/monasteries) => Add a placeholder with a cat meme so replecement is easy
- Add Phoenix (Korean) Castle aestethic (credit to ???) Ask LongusCattus
- edit the dlc_button in gui/frontend_bookmarks.gui (cf "How to add a content source to your events" discord)
- add volcano + texture for dragon lands. How to add new special building in the map (like a bridge for instance)???? 
- Add river map (more ?)
- What about japanese sprawl ? check AEP

## Fixes to do
- Fix the "Family Lands of Daidoji lands"; "Clan of Crane Clan", etc...
- Change color of some textured emblmes (very low priority) : Mantis, Komori
- shiba mon is off-center (too much top left)
- update holy_order decisions & dynasty decisions (taken from shogunate)
- fix title for tribal leader & Theocracy leader of countries/+++ => Ask help to FUN ? Rework ?
	- Check the "Family name before surname" used in "Oriental Empires" mod
	- check Kizoku title & Khan title => Rework of how title are displayed and calculated.
	- "Lowborn" being used as a family name lol
- How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance. Add more family (aka heirs)
- Child can be born with white hair but without the Crane trait !
- some lands (like ryoko owari/ castle of the Hare / Shiro Shugen (lion south)) are NOT considered coastal but have port at startup wtf. Why ? 

## Workaround to be careful with
- headgear remove for all (sub_saharian headgear, why ? Workaround = delete reference to this headgear)

##  Waiting & placeholders
- Cat mon : @Bamba => add a placeholder with a cat meme so repleacement is easy
- Add CoA à la AGOT for all baronnies/counties +++ (ronin done : missing Kingdoms/duchies/monasteries) => Add a placeholder with a cat meme so replecement is easy


## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Remove AI Cadet branches => Working ?
- Becoming Minor or Major Clan IS a special decision which requires the Emperor acknowledgement.
	- Adaptation of the decision "create custom kingdom" but for duchy ?
	- Adaptation of the decision "create custom kingdom" (found_kingdom_decision & found_empire_decision from 80_major_decisions.txt)
	- diseable the "create de_jure kingdom" option ?????
	- Are the "duchy" minor clan & the "kingdom" major clan titles special titles ? Rework those titles with a special flag "recognized_major_clan" for instance. Are they all landless à la Hiruma ?
- Special decisions
	-Become Great Clan : Requires X Duchy or Y counties. Emperor positive relation. Emperor MUST be direct liege. Name of Duchy Title => Name of Kingdom title. Duchy titles become "[DYNASTY] lands"
		- No other ways to create a kingdom title. Basically rework existing mechanics
 	- Become Great Clan (Kingdom) as (Mantis ?) Minor Clan 
	- reclaim ancestral hiruma lands as Hiruma familly
	- if emperor : get a doji bride

	- 5 Doji blades by Doji Yasuragi
		Shukujo, ancestral sword of the crane. If descendant direct of Doji, more bonus. Uchigatana, for duel.

- Have a nice paper map à la Shogunate when zooming out.
- Added demand seppuku character interaction ? (and made by liege too)
	- Issue with Opinion crimed (but no idea how HAS_AN_IMPRISONMENT_REASON_ON_CHARACTER works)
- do a starting event : "Welcome to Rokugan" (à la Tales of Ireland, then comment the trigger for testing) event with explanations of a lot of stuff : This place and about myself. War Changes. Empire of Rokugan. Shadowlands. Magic System. I know everything already
- Special events setting the start of the clan wars
- Duel to end War (check Tales of Ireland mod)
- add "animal" (clan animal) as motif for CoA (instead of just textured one)

	- add more events? Duels ?
=====================================================================================================
============ STOP DEV FEATURES & START POLISHING & ADD 3D/2D ASSETS THEN RELEASE ====================
=====================================================================================================
- economic Opium building for Scorpion heritage ?
- Special Phoenix champion succession, test it !
	- rework princely election, with special character "Ofushikai" being out of map immortal 
	- Current issues : only Holder can vote => Special landess title of Ofushikai.
	- the system needs the current holder to vote.
	- Idea => Create a special succession, and not a princely election ! Without a character Ofushikai !
- Phoenix Council of 5 special government
- Togashi special succession ?
- Special weapon & artifacts
- Black scrolls, cursed artifacts
- Bunch of new events !
- Shindoshi stuff 
- Maho stuff (very low priority)
	- Tomb of Iuchiban special building ?
- Shadowlands stuff (very low priority)


# Decisions Done
- Bleach Hair White (crane) and it's opposite
- Avenge Yasuki War (crane)
- Commit Seppuku (when dishonored)


# Permissions to asks
- Asia Expansion Project @ Longus Cattus => Japanese court, clothes
- Tachi CK3 Mod dev, for inspiration
- FUN for background images for council, characters, court, etc...

# Ideas
### How-to Different species (à la Lotr)
- stat, life expectancies :  based on the heritage of the culture
- in lotr_race_triggers : culture_conversion_to_allowed_culture & same_race. it is used everywhere to prevent weird culture stuff
	- prevent bethrohal in lotr_betrothal_to_allowed
	- prevent cultural hybridization for instance : lotr_is_spirit_culture_trigger usage in "scripted_triggers" dir, used in 00_culture_interactions & culture_events/culture_emergence_events
	- present in scripted_rules\00_rules
