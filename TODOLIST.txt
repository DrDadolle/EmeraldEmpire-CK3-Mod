## To Refines
- Cultures
- Holy sites/ Religions & their icons
- Characters (traits, stats)
- name list by culture (mainly Kaito, Dragon & Unicorn ?)
- Add more historic characters (source : V5 in priority, V4/V1 if family/relationship needed)
- traits & their icons
- dynasty & titles kamon for vassal families, some minor clans (moth), reworked the existing ones
- Question : generated kamon à la shogunate for random dynasties/titles ?
- localization (missing one and change already existing one, like "levies" -> "ashigaru levies" for instance)
- How Minor/Major clan titles are handled
- innovation (special culture ones) and shared ones. Re-localization of some

## short term goals 
- Check that mines works
	- Add mines mesh and/or special building map object data
	- Finish to add all of them (cool when on site)
- move some map object data
	- Musume mura : move the playstack map object to the mid-island
	- Shiro Kosaten : move to the right the player stacck
- Fix river width (3/4 pixel large everywhere)
- better baronies shapes (crane clan, lion clan, scorpion clan)
- fix river heightmap (using gimp I guess)
- Paint the map with materials
- Add bridge mesh map objects
- Add river map
- add missing baronies localization
- Fix the bookmarks, so Doji is not naked, and it looks better
- Last name added to names BUT, need to use spouse name if maried ? Add "of Lands" too ?


## Fixes to do
- Fix the "Family Lands of Daidoji lands"; "Clan of Crane Clan", etc...
- Change color of some textured emblmes (very low priority)
- update holy_order decisions & dynasty decisions (taken from shogunate)
- fix title for tribal leader & Theocracy leader of countries/+++ => Ask help to FUN ? Rework ?
found_empire_decision)
- check Kizoku title & Khan title => Rework of how title are displayed and calculated.
- How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance
- Child can be born with white hair but without the Crane trait !

## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Remove AI Cadet branches => Working ?
- Test "Trial-by-Combat" works even without the DLC
- Check the great walls (à la AEP ?)
- Abdication and become monk (à la RoA)
- Ponder the 3 teachings...??? (à la RoA)
- Add demand seppuku character interaction ? (and made by liege too)
- Becoming Minor or Major Clan IS a special decision which requires the Emperor acknowledgement.
	- Adaptation of the decision "create custom kingdom" but for duchy ?
	- Adaptation of the decision "create custom kingdom" (found_kingdom_decision & found_empire_decision from 80_major_decisions.txt)
	- diseable the "create de_jure kingdom" option ?????
	- Are the "duchy" minor clan & the "kingdom" major clan titles special titles ? Rework those titles with a special flag "recognized_major_clan" for instance. Are they all landless à la Hiruma ?
- Special decisions
	-Become Great Clan : Requires X Duchy or Y counties. Emperor positive relation. Emperor MUST be direct liege. Name of Duchy Title => Name of Kingdom title. Duchy titles become "[DYNASTY] lands"

- ============ STOP DEV FEATURES & START POLISHING & ADD 3D/2D ASSETS THEN RELEASE ====================
- Special Phoenix champion succession, test it !
	- rework princely election, with special character "Ofushikai" being out of map immortal 
	- Current issues : only Holder can vote => Special landess title of Ofushikai.
	- the system needs the current holder to vote.
	- Idea => Create a special succession, and not a princely election ! Without a character Ofushikai !
- Phoenix Council of 5 special government
- Togashi special succession ?
- Special weapon & artifacts
- Black scrolls, cursed artifacts
- Shindoshi stuff (very low priority)
- Maho stuff (very low priority)
	- Tomb of Iuchiban special building ?
- Shadowlands stuff (very low priority)


# Decisions Done
- Bleach Hair White (crane) and it's opposite
- Avenge Yasuki War (crane)
- Commit Seppuku (when dishonored)


# Permissions to asks
- Asia Expansion Project @ Longus Cattus => Japanese unit models
- Kefir => Japanese buildings & unit models
- Tachi CK3 Mod dev, for inspiration
- FUN for background images for council, characters, court, etc...

# Ideas
### How-to Different species (à la Lotr)
- stat, life expectancies :  based on the heritage of the culture
- in lotr_race_triggers : culture_conversion_to_allowed_culture & same_race. it is used everywhere to prevent weird culture stuff
	- prevent bethrohal in lotr_betrothal_to_allowed
	- prevent cultural hybridization for instance : lotr_is_spirit_culture_trigger usage in "scripted_triggers" dir, used in 00_culture_interactions & culture_events/culture_emergence_events
	- present in scripted_rules\00_rules
