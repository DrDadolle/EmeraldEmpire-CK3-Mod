## To Refines
- Cultures
- Holy sites/ Religions & their icons
- Characters (traits, stats)
- name list by culture (mainly Kaito, Dragon & Unicorn ?)
- Add more historic characters (source : V5 in priority, V4/V1 if family/relationship needed)
- traits & their icons
- dynasty & titles kamon for vassal families, some minor clans (moth), reworked the existing ones
- Question : generated kamon à la shogunate for random dynasties/titles ?
- localization (missing one and change already existing one, like "levies" -> "ashigaru levies" for instance)
- How Minor/Major clan titles are handled
- innovation (special culture ones) and shared ones. Re-localization of some
- Colors of clothes variations
- Events ideas
- more artifacts

## CK3 1.13.* patch
- Vanilla often replaces is_landed with is_playable_character  or is_landed_or_landless_administrative. If you want landless characters to have access to your content, you would need to do the same.
- Scheme modifiers have been completely reworked, so all the old ones for things like personal_scheme_power_mult, hostile_scheme_resistance_add, etc. no longer work. You will need to replace them with new scheme modifier
	- check scheme.info of vanilla game
- remove bunch of errors
- Once error removed, investigate why first lauch of mod crashes, then not anymore
- Add thumbnail image for the mod !
- Add lion clan bookmark map
	- Akodo Toturi : TODO DNA
- update crane clan bookmark map
	- Doji Kuwanan : TODO DNA

## CK3 1.14.2 patch
- update common/travel/point_of_interest_types/travel_point_of_interest_types.txt 
- update descriptor.mod to replace all bookmarks !

## short term goals 
- restore court_events_general.txt from vanilla
- update text of studied_the_battle_of_thermopylae & co (localization)
- update event/heresy_events.txt
- update 01_events_backgrounds.txt
-Cisterns/qanats and other regional buildings are available
- found Great Clan description decision
	- missing description descision, issue with custom description
- Update "Reclaim Yasuki Family lands" & "Reborn Snake" decision
	- check description Yasuki decision
	- check yasuki crane culture (tribal)
	- check chuda culture (tribal)
- Why so much empty space in portrait debug mod ?
- Create MaA for each great clan, (do the same for minor later)
	- MaA preferences by heritage => Building_Modifiers.txt & 04_ep2_maa_attributes to update
	- 00_men_at_arms_values to update too
	- add special icons/images for MaA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (crab done, rest to do)
- Fix mercenary companies names / culture ?
	- How to ?
- Random mon for generated characters ?
	- Based on shogunate mod
		- common/coat_of_arms/template_lists coa_templates
	- check ronins & church_holders

## Fixes to do
- Spammed with rokugan_char_interaction.0231 event boxes...
	- "an honorable death" event procs for outsite of player stuff
- Change color of some textured emblmes (very low priority) : Mantis, Komori
- shiba mon is off-center (too much top left)
- update holy_order decisions & dynasty decisions (taken from shogunate)
- d_rokugani_faith got split from e_rokugan. Should follow it (but follow primary heir instead) ? Or not, the title should become "Shogun" I guess ?
	- See k_orthodox as head of faith title ? e_rokugan becomes the head of faith title ??
-Change Mod Thumbnail image (test ?)
- Added demand seppuku character interaction ? (and made by liege too)
	- Issue with Opinion crimed (but no idea how HAS_AN_IMPRISONMENT_REASON_ON_CHARACTER works)
- Issues with missing accolades in innovations description ? Why ?
- [ Invalid building 'haunted_ruins_shiro_chuda_04' ]
- start war on toshi Rambo / city rich frog decision
	- Bug : on_war_transferred => war_event.2001 gets called because we target the small owner instead of the big liege. 

## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Set up github branches (dev/release/beta) and pratices/rights
- Pilgrimage images (update scripted_illustration/ingame.txt)
- new building type for Mantis : https://discord.com/channels/735413460439007241/1139782281142222969
- new building type for Dragon : https://github.com/Ivan-2/KefirsHoldings


##  Waiting & placeholders
- Cat mon : @Bamba 
- Add CoA placeholder : missing Frog Duchy, Kingdom of Cherry blossom and that's it ?

## Workaround to be careful with & unsure behaviours
- headgear remove for all (sub_saharian headgear, why ? Workaround = delete reference to this headgear)
- Remove AI Cadet branches => Working ?
- Doji Hotaru black hair on bookmarks to avoid having white hair children without the crane trait
- How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance. Add more family (aka heirs)
- start war on toshi Rambo / city rich frog decision
	- Bug : on_war_transferred => war_event.2001 gets called because we target the small owner instead of the big liege. 
- weird log issue : [19:35:39][characterhistory.cpp:801]: Parent ( Hantei of  (Internal ID: 3 - Historical ID lineofhantei1)) of name_genji Lowborn of  (Internal ID: 18 - Historical ID lineofhantei2) is hasn't been born

# Ideas
### How-to Different species (à la Lotr)
- stat, life expectancies :  based on the heritage of the culture
- in lotr_race_triggers : culture_conversion_to_allowed_culture & same_race. it is used everywhere to prevent weird culture stuff
	- prevent bethrohal in lotr_betrothal_to_allowed
	- prevent cultural hybridization for instance : lotr_is_spirit_culture_trigger usage in "scripted_triggers" dir, used in 00_culture_interactions & culture_events/culture_emergence_events
	- present in scripted_rules\00_rules
