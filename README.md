## Special Rules
This mod has special rules described below. We may change them in the future.

Those changes are made as the map is smaller and all samourai shares the same language.
- Cultural Acceptance is lower, as all Clans share the same language (-15 -> -20 & -30 -> -40 for same realm)
- Maximum 1 held duchy (if you are King or higher) before opinion loss
- Stewardship grants less bonus domains (from /6 to /7)

Wars requires more prestige within the emerald empire if
- You are a Major Clan & target is minor Clan OR target primary title has a lower title (Minor Clan Protection by Imperial Edict)
- You are a Major Clan & the target is a Major Clan (No Major Clan Warfare by Imperial Edict)

New Special Decisions
- It is possible to create Custom Duchies (called Minor Clans) via a decision
