## short term goals
- paint minor clans
- Paint some ronin lands 
- count for LastHopeShinsei & some monks for the monasteries
- create Kakoga lands near shinomen mori.
- Have a not-so-ugly heightmap
- Fix river & coast => Once fixed, redo provinces
- Paint the map with materials
- Paint & do rivers crossing zones (and adjencies.csv)
- Paint & do Sea zones 
- Rework provinces, so looks better
- Add river map

# Fixes to do
- How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ???
- Fix coast line ugly of Phoenix lands (& cranes)
- Add last name before first name "Clan Champion Doji Hotaru of Crane Clan" instead "Clan Champion Hotaru of Crane Clan"
- Fix the "Family Lands of Daidoji lands"; "Clan of Crane Clan", etc...
- Fix Dynasties visual display of CoA => remove all transparency ???
- add culture title for kasuga : Kizoku
- Do as "sultanate" based on dynasty name but ONLY for duchy titles ????

## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Bushido & Duels
- Seppuku
- Child Adoption
- Painting Hair White decision for crane cultures
- reduce size of domain that can be kept (Ã  la AGOT mod), because map is so small (~10 counties per kindgom)
- Genetic Trait "Natural white hair" for Crane ???
- Right/Left/UnderHand special trait for clan champion of crane/lion/scorpion
- Blood feud (like Matsu vs Kakita)
- Special decisions
	- Retake Yasuki Lands as Crane Clan
 	- Become Great Clan (Kingdom) as (Mantis ?) Minor Clan 
	- reclaim ancestral hiruma lands as Hiruma familly
- Special protection against conquest for un-aligned/minor/imperial lands => Casus belli way more costly + lose of prestige ?
- Special Phoenix champion succession
- Phoenix Council of 5 special government
- Togashi special succession ?
- Special weapon & artifacts
- Black scrolls, cursed artifacts
- Shindoshi stuff (very low priority)
- Maho stuff (very low priority)
- Shadowlands stuff (very low priority)
