## How to install
Copy paste everything in your mod folder. Don't forget to update the path in RokuganWIP.mod.

## short term goals
- Check that Bushido tradition works :  Duels & Child Adoption
- paint minor clans (Moth Clan north of Falcon Clan)
- Paint some ronin lands & Brother hood to complete the map for now
- count for LastHopeShinsei & some monks for the monasteries
- Have a not-so-ugly heightmap
	- Fix river & coast => Once fixed, redo provinces
- Paint the map with materials
- Paint & do Sea zones 
- Rework provinces, so looks better
- Add river map
- provinces terrain (plains, etc...)
- Add more characters 
- vassal families
- Last name added to names BUT, need to use spouse name if maried ? Add "of Lands" too ?

# Fixes to do
- Soshi daimyo not generated
- Change color of some textured emblmes
- Kaito Lands not accessible, change mask of fog
- Some counties are "coastal" even if they are near rivers... todo after all sea provinces mapped
- How to prevent random mariage & children in existing character ? => change game_rule.1001 ??? gamerule_1001 force generate descendance
- Fix the "Family Lands of Daidoji lands"; "Clan of Crane Clan", etc...
- add culture title for kasuga : Kizoku
- clean up of traits (like removing Hajji  from pilgrim traits)
- Do as "sultanate" based on dynasty name but ONLY for duchy titles ????

## Futures Features & Nice to have
- Remove AI Cadet branches
- Seppuku as  part of "Bushido tradition". Special decision if "dishonored"
- Painting Hair White decision for crane cultures
- reduce size of domain that can be kept (Ã  la AGOT mod), because map is so small (~10 counties per kindgom)
- Genetic Trait "Natural white hair" for Crane ???
- Right/Left/UnderHand special trait for clan champion of crane/lion/scorpion
- Blood feud (like Matsu vs Kakita)
- Add ancestral clan & family founders
- Special decisions
	-Become Great Clan : Requires X Duchy or Y counties. Emperor positive relation. Emperor MUST be direct liege. Name of Duchy Title => Name of Kingdom title. Duchy titles become "[DYNASTY] lands"
		- No other ways to create a kingdom title. Basically rework existing mechanics
	- Retake Yasuki Lands as Crane Clan
 	- Become Great Clan (Kingdom) as (Mantis ?) Minor Clan 
	- reclaim ancestral hiruma lands as Hiruma familly
	- if emperor : get a doji bride
	- if emperor : all siblings goes to "Otomo" once there is an heir + The revert decision
- Special protection against conquest for un-aligned/minor/imperial lands => Casus belli way more costly + lose of prestige ?
- Special Phoenix champion succession
- Phoenix Council of 5 special government
- Togashi special succession ?
- Special weapon & artifacts
- Black scrolls, cursed artifacts
- Shindoshi stuff (very low priority)
- Maho stuff (very low priority)
- Shadowlands stuff (very low priority)

## What is done
- provinces with historic & placeholder characters (random traits)
	- crane clan
	- lion clan
	- phoenix clan
	- Scorpion clan
	- Hantei & Seppun lands
	- Crab lands
	- Unicorn Lands
	- Dragons Lands
	- Kasuga/Moshi/Tsuruchi/Suzume/Kitsune/Toritaka/Komori/Nekoma
- all cultures & religion (draft)
- basic Coat of Arms for Clans & Families (late are buggy, weird colors)
