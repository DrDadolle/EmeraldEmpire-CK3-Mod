Gisei Toshi was the final resting place of the Tao of Shinsei, as well as many other artifacts that the Isawa collected over the centuries that they do not want known to the empire as a whole.

Influence there was divided among wealthy merchants, Scorpion Clan nobles, and the more noteworthy commoners, resulting in an uneasy equality that many samurai regarded as chaotic. Yet this chaos was deemed a necessary evil by the city's Scorpion lords, as Journey's End City was not only the Empire's primary source of opium—one of the few effective painkillers available and an important medication when used responsibly—but also an important cover for more clandestine operations."
