 BattlePoIHistoricalDescVictoryNoStrike:0 "#emp Victor: Doji Kiriko\nDefeated: Master of Air Isawa Asahina\nDate: 353 AD#!\n#weak Outraged over what he perceived as meddling, the war obsessed Phoenix Master of Air Isawa Asahina, began ransacking villages in Crane territory.\n\nThe Crane Clan Champion's daughter Doji Kiriko rode out to stop Asahina in the Kimura village that was threatened by his predations. She took up a stance directly in front of him, never fighting back, and mutely stood her ground against him. Behind her, horrified Crane peasants watched as Asahina struck at her unyielding form.\n\nShe took many wounds from his sword, but when he had nearly killed her he awoke from his rage and realized his terrible error. Kiriko had not only saved the Crane villagers, she had also saved Asahina from himself, a victory with no strike.#!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalDescStolenGraves:0 "#emp Victor: Emerald Empire Kiriko\nDefeated: Iuchiban of the Bloodspeakers\nDate: 510 AD#!\n#weak Iuchiban had raised a zombie army within Otosan Uchi and sent them against the Imperial Palace. The undead were unaffected by most of the blows they suffered, and were supported by Madoshi.\n\nWith a common enemy the Clans united against the cult and crushed them. Akodo Minobe was the first to breach the temple's defenses and before the Heartless could use his maho the Lion stabbed him with a spear.\n\nWith Iuchiban down, the battle was won and the animated corpses were returned to their graves.#!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalDescCrestingWave:0 "#emp Victor: Crab Clan\nDefeated: The Maw of the Shadowlands\nDate: 716 AD#!\n#weak As the Crab desperately formed a final defensive line along the Seigo River, a shugenja named Kuni Osaku importuned the water kami to raise the river in a massive flood. So great was the torrent that the Maw's army was halted, unable to proceed any farther. Seizing the opportunity, the Crab Champion, Hida Banuken, ordered the Crab to begin construction of durable defensive work along the river's eastern bank. For seventy-three days the Crab labored feverishly, while Osaku maintained her invocation.\n\nOn the seventy-fourth day, Osaku's strength finally failed, and she died. As the flood receded, the Maw drove its army forward, only to slam headlong into a mighty wall, the Kaiu Wall. The Crab immediately counterattacked the stalled and confused horde.\n\nThe clash, which came to be known as the Battle of the Cresting Wave, saw the Maw slain and consigned back to the underworld, its great army routed and scattered.#!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameWhiteShorePlain:0 "The Battle of White Shore Plain"
 BattlePoIHistoricalDescWhiteShorePlain:0 "#emp Victor: Unicorn Clan\nDefeated: Scorpion Clan of the Bloodspeakers\nDate: 815 AD#!\n#weak It was one of the pivotal battles during the Return of the Ki-Rin. Rokugan had witnessed the emergence an unknown force from within the Shadowlands that broke through the Crab Clan defenses and began moving across the empire. The Scorpion Clan quickly mobilized an army to oppose the unknown force.\n\nGeneral Bayushi Tozasu was charged with leading the Scorpion army, and he selected mainly inferior troops after his Champion ordered him to lose the upcoming battle. He endured a bitter defeat against Unicorn cavalry and a small contingent of Lion.\n\nThe Scorpion Clan Champion at the time, Bayushi Ogoe, sent a message to the Unicorn, to apologize and also to officially recognize the Unicorn Clan after their victorious battle. The defeat at the hands of the Unicorn meant the Scorpion were perceived as inferior both in battle and court. Even the Lion and Crane felt their resentment of the Scorpion diminish, and this allowed the Scorpion to seem weak while playing other clans against each other.#!"
