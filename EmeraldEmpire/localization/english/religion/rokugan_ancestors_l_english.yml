 ancestors_religion_desc:0 "The reverence and worship of departed ancestors is the oldest form of religion in Rokugan. It is believed that after death, the spirits of the departed live on in one of several Spirit Realms, and that they can see and even interact with their descendants still alive in Ningen-do, especially those who have entered Yomi -- Realm of the Blessed Ancestors. These spirits can offer aid in the way of blessings or advice, or offer correction in the form of haunting. People offer gifts of food, prayer, and incense to their ancestors, either as thanks for their aid or appeasement from their haunting."
