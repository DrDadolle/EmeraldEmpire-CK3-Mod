Any who called on Shinsei the Little Teacher, chanting the phrase Shoshi ni kie would be freed from the cycle of rebirth. They said they would find enlightenment after death, in the paradise they said Shinsei had created for them. The sect did not tolerate worship of the Fortunes or even the ancestors."
